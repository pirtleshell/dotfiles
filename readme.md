Here resideth pirtle's dotfiles. It's about time I made it an externally hosted repo.

Dear Future Pirtle, [check this](http://dotfiles.github.io/).

# license

If you find anything here (that I wrote!) useful, feel free to steal and use. It mostly exists for my sanity.
Consider it all [unlicensed](https://unlicense.org/).

I am unable to relicense anything which was released by someone else.
